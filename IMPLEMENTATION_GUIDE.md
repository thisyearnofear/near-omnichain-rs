# 🚀 Real Transactions Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to implement real cross-chain transactions using the enhanced omni-transaction library with WASM integration.

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ **Completed (Phase 1)**
- **WASM Integration**: Added WebAssembly bindings for Rust library
- **Enhanced Transaction Manager**: Created `WasmTransactionManager` with real NEAR network integration
- **Bridge Contract**: Basic NEAR smart contract for cross-chain authorization
- **Real Network Info**: Fetching actual block hash, nonce, and account data from NEAR
- **USDC Balance Checks**: Validating user balance before transactions
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallback from WASM to regular transaction manager

### 🔧 **Next Steps (Phase 2-4)**

## 🏗️ **Phase 2: Build and Deploy**

### Step 1: Build WASM Module
```bash
# Install wasm-pack if not already installed
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Build the WASM module
./build-wasm.sh
```

This will:
- Compile Rust library to WebAssembly
- Generate JavaScript bindings
- Copy files to `frontend/src/wasm/`

### Step 2: Deploy Bridge Contract
```bash
# Install NEAR CLI
npm install -g near-cli

# Navigate to bridge contract
cd bridge-contract

# Build and deploy
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh testnet your-bridge-account.testnet
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration
```javascript
// In frontend/src/config/constants.js
export const CONFIG = {
    CONTRACTS: {
        USDC_BASE: '0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e', // ✅ Already correct
        BRIDGE_NEAR: 'your-bridge-account.testnet', // 🔧 Update this
    },
    // ... rest of config
};
```

## 🧪 **Phase 3: Testing Real Transactions**

### Test NEAR Transactions
1. **Connect NEAR Wallet**: Use testnet account with some NEAR tokens
2. **Test Authorization**: Submit a cross-chain transfer authorization
3. **Verify on Chain**: Check transaction on [NEAR Explorer](https://testnet.nearblocks.io)

### Test USDC Transfers
1. **Get Test USDC**: Obtain USDC on Base Sepolia testnet
2. **Connect MetaMask**: Switch to Base Sepolia network
3. **Test Transfer**: Execute a real USDC transfer

## 🔧 **Phase 4: Advanced Features**

### Real Signature Verification
```rust
// In bridge-contract/src/lib.rs
pub fn verify_near_signature(
    &self,
    message: Vec<u8>,
    signature: String,
    public_key: String,
) -> bool {
    // TODO: Implement actual cryptographic verification
    // 1. Parse ED25519/SECP256K1 signature
    // 2. Verify against message hash
    // 3. Return verification result
}
```

### Cross-Chain Relayer
```javascript
// Create a relayer service that:
// 1. Monitors NEAR bridge contract for authorizations
// 2. Executes corresponding EVM transactions
// 3. Updates status back on NEAR contract
```

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Items**

### 1. Build WASM (5 minutes)
```bash
./build-wasm.sh
```

### 2. Test Frontend (10 minutes)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Connect wallets
- Try a transaction (will use WASM if available)

### 3. Deploy Bridge Contract (15 minutes)
```bash
cd bridge-contract
./deploy.sh testnet
```

### 4. Update Configuration (2 minutes)
- Update `BRIDGE_NEAR` address in constants.js
- Test with real bridge contract

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### WASM Build Issues
```bash
# If wasm-pack fails
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack

# If dependencies fail
cargo clean
cargo build
```

### NEAR Contract Issues
```bash
# Check account exists
near state your-bridge-account.testnet

# View contract methods
near view your-bridge-account.testnet get_version

# Check logs
near tx-status YOUR_TX_HASH --accountId your-account.testnet
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
cd frontend && npm install

# Check WASM files
ls -la frontend/src/wasm/
```

## 📊 **Testing Checklist**

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] WASM module loads successfully
- [ ] NEAR wallet connects
- [ ] MetaMask connects to Base Sepolia
- [ ] Real block hash and nonce fetched from NEAR
- [ ] USDC balance check works
- [ ] Transaction form validation works

### Real Transactions
- [ ] NEAR authorization transaction submits
- [ ] Transaction appears on NEAR Explorer
- [ ] USDC transfer executes on Base
- [ ] Transaction appears on Base Explorer
- [ ] Bridge contract stores authorization
- [ ] Status updates correctly

### Error Handling
- [ ] Insufficient USDC balance handled
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] WASM fallback to regular manager works
- [ ] Invalid addresses rejected
- [ ] Gas estimation works

## 🚀 **Production Readiness**

### Security Considerations
1. **Signature Verification**: Implement proper cryptographic verification
2. **Access Control**: Add proper authorization to bridge contract
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam transactions
4. **Audit**: Security audit of smart contracts

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Gas Optimization**: Optimize contract gas usage
2. **Caching**: Cache network calls where possible
3. **Batch Operations**: Support batch transfers
4. **Indexing**: Efficient transfer lookup

### Monitoring
1. **Transaction Tracking**: Monitor cross-chain transfers
2. **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking
3. **Metrics**: Performance and usage metrics
4. **Alerts**: Failed transaction notifications

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Check NEAR and Base network status
4. Verify contract deployments

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

You'll know the implementation is working when:
- ✅ WASM module loads without errors
- ✅ Real NEAR transactions are created and signed
- ✅ Actual USDC transfers execute on Base
- ✅ Bridge contract records authorizations
- ✅ Cross-chain flow completes end-to-end

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-3 hours for basic functionality, 1-2 days for production-ready implementation.
