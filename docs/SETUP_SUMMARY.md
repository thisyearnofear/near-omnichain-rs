# Project Setup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Installed Rust and Dependencies**
   - Set up Rust with the stable channel
   - Added the wasm32-unknown-unknown target
   - Fixed dependency issues in Cargo.toml

2. **Built the Project**
   - Successfully compiled the library

3. **Created Documentation**
   - `GETTING_STARTED.md` - A guide to help you get started with the project
   - `NEAR_SIGNATURES_GUIDE.md` - Detailed explanation of using NEAR signatures for cross-chain transactions

4. **Created Examples**
   - `examples/near_signature_example.rs` - Basic example of NEAR transaction signing
   - `examples/cross_chain_example.rs` - Example demonstrating cross-chain transactions

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Examples**
   ```bash
   cargo run --example cross_chain_example
   ```

2. **Explore the Integration Tests**
   The integration tests in the `tests/` directory provide real-world examples of how to use the library.

3. **Build Your Own Cross-Chain Application**
   Use the library to build your own application that leverages NEAR signatures for cross-chain transactions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Dependency Problems**
   - Make sure you have the latest version of Rust installed
   - Try running `cargo update` to update dependencies

2. **Build Errors**
   - Check that you have the wasm32-unknown-unknown target installed
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in Cargo.toml

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Make sure you're using valid keys and addresses in your examples
   - Check the documentation for correct usage of the API
